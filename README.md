RacketScript is an **experimental** lightweight Racket to JavaScript
compiler. The generated code is ES6, which can be translated to ES5
using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
or [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler). RacketScript
aims to leverage both JavaScript and Racket's ecosystem, and make
interoperability between them clean and smooth.

RacketScript takes in Racket source files, uses Racket's macro
expander to
produce
[Fully Expanded Programs](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/syntax-model.html#%28part._fully-expanded%29),
and then compile these fully expanded programs to
JavaScript. RacketScript doesn't support Racket features which are
expensive, for example proper tail calls and continuations.

## Try RacketScript

You can try RacketScript in your browser
at [RacketScript Playground](http://rapture.twistedplane.com:8080/).

## Disclaimer

RacketScript is **work-in-progress** and is not mature and stable.
Several Racket features and libraries are not yet implemeted
(eg. number pyramid, contracts, tail calls, primitives). That said,
we encourage experimentation, user feedback, discussions, bug reports
and pull requests.

## Installation

Following system packages are required -

- [Racket](http://www.racket-lang.org/) 6.4 or higher
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (4.0 or higher) and NPM
- Make

### Quick Install

RacketScript can be installed by running one of the following commands
in your terminal.

For installation via `raco`

```sh
raco pkg install racketscript
```

For installation via `curl`

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishesh/racketscript/master/install.sh)"
```

Or, for installation via `wget`

```sh
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishesh/racketscript/master/install.sh -O -)"
```

See [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) to get started.

### Install from Github

Once RacketScript is cloned in your machine -

1. Fire up your terminal and goto the root directory of the
   repository.
2. Execute `make setup` to install RacketScript compiler and all its
   dependencies.

Although not required, it is strongly recommeded that you install
Traceur, and Gulp as global packages.

```sh
npm install -g traceur gulp
```

If you do not wish to pollute your root NPM directory, you can set a
custom global location by changing your `npmrc` (eg.  `echo "prefix =
$HOME/.npm-packages" >> ~/.npmrc`. Then add `/prefix/path/above/bin`
to your `PATH`.

RacketScript will generate Gulpfiles to compile ES6 to ES5 using
Traceur or Babel.  If you wish to run ES6 modules directly, install
Traceur using NPM. Babel is recommended for writing NodeJS programs.

## Basic Usage

RacketScript compiler is named `racks`. 

```sh
racks -h # show help
```
	
To compile a Racket source file:

```sh
# Installs all NPM dependencies and compile file.rkt
racks /path/to/file.rkt
```
	
The above command will create a output build directory named
`js-build`, copy RacketScript runtime, copy other support files,
install NPM dependencies, compile `file.rkt` and its dependencies.

The compiled ES6 modules typically goto one of following three
folders:

- "modules": The normal Racket files.
- "collects": Racket collects source files.
- "links": Other third party packages.
- "dist": Contains sources compiled to ES6 or bundled JavaScript ready
  for distribution.

Here are few other examples that would come in handy:

```sh
# To skip `npm install` step. Useful when building
# for second time.
racks -n /path/to/source.rkt
	
# To beautify assembled modules use `-b`. Make sure
# `js-beautify` is installed from NPM or your
# package manager.
racks -b /path/to/source.rkt

# Override default output directory
racks -d /path/to/output/dir /path/to/source.rkt
	
# Print JavaScript output to stdout
racks --js --js-beautify /path/to/source.rkt
```
		
By default tail call optimization is turned off. To enable translation
of self recursive tail calls to loop, pass `--enable-self-tail` flag.

```sh
racks --enable-self-tail /path/to/source.rkt
```

### Traceur

By default RacketScript will use Traceur and produce
`dist/compiled.js`. To execute inside NodeJS, execute `bootstrap.js`
in output directory. For running in browser, either use
`traceur-browser` target, or include the Traceur runtime along with
`dist/compiled.js`.

```sh
# Use `--target` or `-t` flag.

# For command line. You can ignore this flag.
racks --target traceur /path/to/source.rkt

# For targeting browser.
racks --target traceur-browser /path/to/source.rkt
```

A more robust (and less portable) way, is to run the ES6 modules
generated in `modules` directly from Traceur. Goto `modules` output
directory and execute `$ traceur /path/to/source.js`.

### Babel

RacketScript could also use `Babel`. It will compile each assembled ES6
module to ES5, and put it in `dist` directory, persevering original
directory structure. Replace above command with following -

```sh
# Use `--target` or `-t` flag.
racks --target babel /path/to/source.rkt
```

This will compile each ES6 module generated by RacketScript, and put
in dist with same directory structure. Babel is highly recommended if
your target is NodeJS.

## Hacking

If you wish to hack on RacketScript code or run tests, lints and
coverage tool, run `make setup-extra` from RacketScript root
directory.  See [Makefile](Makefile) for more targets. This will also
install `js-beautify` which produces beautified JavaScript output.

The compiler is written in Typed Racket. To avoid long startups, it is
advised to pre-compile Racket sources to bytecode.

```sh
# From source root
make build
```

### Running Tests

```sh
# Run unit tests
$ make unit-tests

# Run integration tests
make integration-test
	
# Run all tests
make test
```

### Coverage
	
To test Racket output against JavaScript output of specific Racket
source file(s), use [fixtures.rkt](test/fixtures.rkt). Run
`./fixtures.rkt -h` inside `$RACKETSCRIPT/tests` directory to see
basic usage.

For running coverage:

```sh
make coverage # Consider coverage of all tests
make coverage-unit-test # Just consider unit-test coverage
```

### Other Tips

If you develop with mutiple versions of Racket and don't have
the current Racket bin dir in your path, you may find the following
`racks` shim useful (place it in your bin path):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

"$(racket -e "(require setup/dirs) (display (find-user-console-bin-dir))")/racks" "$@"
```

### Submitting Patches

Create a *pull request* against `develop` branch.
